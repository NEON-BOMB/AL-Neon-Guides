1. <a name="getstart">Getting Started</a>
   Submarines are, essentially, a offensive support mechanic in Azur Lane. They work as a separate fleet within the map, actively seeking enemies within their **Hunting Range** for a **Preemptive Attack**. Alternatively, they can be **called in battle** to support your fleet with direct damage as long as their operational time allows them to, more on a Submarine's functions later.
   Submarines require special equipment, namely Submarine Torpedoes, which can be acquired by doing SOS Maps. To do SOS Maps, one must first acquire **ASW**(Anti Submarine Warfare) equipment for their shipgirls. DDs and CLs are able to equip standard ASW equipment, CVLs are able to equip ASW Planes (in their auxiliary slots). 
   
1.1 Acquiring your first submarine
  Through the one-time Task "Submarine, Reporting In!"**(Clear 3-4)**, you will receive a free I-58 and a pair of ASW equipment. (Depth Charge Launcher and Sonar).
  More submarines are available in the Special Gacha, but some are event-only. 
  
1.2 Acquiring your starter ASW equipment
  The same one-time task "Submarine, Reporting In!" will provide you with your starter ASW equipment, but it's possible to acquire more through the special Equipment Box available in the Medal Exchange. Important to note that the Equipment Box will also have ASW Planes that are equippable 
  
 1.3 SOS Maps
  Refer to this page https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Anti-Submarine_Warfare#SOS_Signal_Search for a guide on how to access SOS maps and to this https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Anti-Submarine_Warfare#Mechanics to learn how ASW works. This video https://twitter.com/azurlane_staff/status/1007152330746130432 shows Sonar and Depth Charge in action. 
  
 1.3.1 How to efficiently raise Signal Sensitivity
  One wants to achieve maximum Signal Sensititivy (8 charges, up to world 10) the quickest possible. To do that, the most efficient way is to follow these steps:
  - Store charges up to the maximum capacity, then use all of them at once.
  - Only clear the highest SOS mission available.
  - Wait for two Signals to be replenished. *This is a bit of RNG, since a signal can be replenished every 30 mins, but if you're unlucky, you get a guaranteed charge every 8 hours. Sadly waiting on two charges has a small change of exceeding the duration limit of SOS missions (12 hours)*. **If you have a Distress Signal Reception Device, you may use one or two to guarantee the two Signals.**
  - Use the two Signals, which guarantees that one of them will be the latest world you unlocked two steps above.
  - Repeat until w10 or until the highest world you have cleared. (Example: You need to clear 8-4 to be able to receive a signal for World 8)
 
  Alternatively, one may wish to just count on sheer RNG to raise the Signal Sensitivity, but as it will be explained below, raising the Signal Sensitivity quickly is **very desired**.
  
  
2. How Submarines Work
  Submarines are mostly independent and automatic, with the player being only able to activate or deactivate their **Prowler Mode** or call them into battle if they're within range. 
  **Prowler Mode** launches a preemptive strike on an enemy node, reducing the HP of ALL enemies within the node by a set %. 
  **Alterntively, you can call submarines to help you in battle**. They will automatically to attack with their torpedoes for a limited amount of time (while being immune to enemy attacks). Once the time ends, they are forced to surface(becoming exposed to enemy attacks) and will keep attacking with torpedoes and their guns for 6 seconds before retreating from combat. 
   **Submarines can only do either function while they have more than 0 ammo, either function consumes 1 ammo. Each submarine brings 2 ammo to the fleet, to a maximum of 6 ammo to be used.**
  
2.1 Hunting Range
  A Submarine's operational area is called their Hunting Range, as seen in the example below. A Submarine Fleet's Hunting Range is determined **by the submarine in the first slot.**. 
  [insert screenshot]
  
 
  
 There are 5 levels of Hunting Range. Submarines start at level 1, and have their range raised to level 2 at the second Limit Break. To further increase their Hunting Range, one can equip a Submarine with the aux equip Battery or equip the submarine fleet with Meowficers. Currently, two Meowficers are able to raise a Submarine's Hunting Range: (SSR) Steel and (SR)Eldeweiss. Using both Meowfices and a Battery will allow a Submarine to achieve Hunting Range Level. 5, **but as it will be explained below, achieving Level 5 is not particularly important.**
  Different Submarines have different shapes to their Hunting Ranges.

2.2 Prowler Mode 
  When Prowler Mode is active, a Submarine will seek the closest enemy node within it's Hunting Range and perform a preemptive strike, reducing every enemy's HP within the node by a percentage of their total health. Submarine Fleets move 2 tiles every time a player moves any of their fleets any number of tiles. **Boss Nodes aren't affected by this and thus Submarines ignore them while in Prowler Mode.** 
  [Insert Gif of the above happening]
  
  **Submarines use the following rules to determine which enemy to seek[By Hayashi#8923]:
  [make this collapsible]
1. When an enemy fleet spawns directly under your submarine fleet, it will always attack without moving.
2. If in its path to seek a higher-priority fleet, it stops below another fleet, it will always attack. (It will not attack if it passes through another fleet, it must actually stop under it.)
3. Based on the fleet's Level 1 Radius, it will attack the northernmost fleet first.
4. If there are more than two fleets in the same row, it will attack the westernmost fleet first in that row.
5. If there are no valid targets in the Level 1 Radius, it will recalculate steps 3-4 for Level 2, then Level 3, etc.

Therefore, even though U-47 and U-81 appear to have identical hunting radii at Level 4, their performance is NOT identical as:

For example, if there are only two fleets in the radius, one located two northwest diagonals and one located two southwest diagonals from the centre point, a fleet with a U-81 flagship will go for the northwest fleet first (as only that fleet exists in U-81's Level 2 Radius), while a fleet with a U-47 flagship will go for the southwest fleet first (as only that fleet exists in U-47's Level 1 Radius).

The formula used to determine the % of health reduced from a node is the following:

Thus, if your objective is to have the highest health reduction possible, it's always recommended to run 3 SSs in a submarine fleet.

2.3 Call-in 
  If your fleet engages an enemy within a Submarine's Hunting Range, you will have the option of
