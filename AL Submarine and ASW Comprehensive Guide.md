1. <a name="getstart">Getting Started</a>
   Submarines are, essentially, a offensive support mechanic in Azur Lane. They work as a separate fleet within the map, actively seeking enemies within their **Hunting Range** for a **Preemptive Attack**. Alternatively, they can be **called in battle** to support your fleet with direct damage as long as their operational time allows them to, more on a Submarine's functions later.
   Submarines require special equipment, namely Submarine Torpedoes, which can be acquired by doing SOS Maps. To do SOS Maps, one must first acquire **ASW**(Anti Submarine Warfare) equipment for their shipgirls. DDs and CLs are able to equip standard ASW equipment, CVLs are able to equip ASW Planes (in their auxiliary slots). 
   
1.1 Acquiring your first submarine
  Through the one-time Task "Submarine, Reporting In!"**(Clear 3-4)**, you will receive a free I-58 and a pair of ASW equipment. (Depth Charge Launcher and Sonar).
  More submarines are available in the Special Gacha, but some are event-only. 
  
1.2 Acquiring your starter ASW equipment
  The same one-time task "Submarine, Reporting In!" will provide you with your starter ASW equipment, but it's possible to acquire more through the special Equipment Box available in the Medal Exchange. Important to note that the Equipment Box will also have ASW Planes that are equippable 
  
 1.3 SOS Maps
  Refer to this page https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Anti-Submarine_Warfare#SOS_Signal_Search for a guide on how to access SOS maps and to this https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Anti-Submarine_Warfare#Mechanics to learn how ASW works. This video https://twitter.com/azurlane_staff/status/1007152330746130432 shows Sonar and Depth Charge in action. 
  
 1.3.1 How to efficiently raise Signal Sensitivity
  One wants to achieve maximum Signal Sensititivy (8 charges, up to world 10) the quickest possible. To do that, the most efficient way is to follow these steps:
  - Store charges up to the maximum capacity, then use all of them at once.
  - Only clear the highest SOS mission available.
  - Wait for two Signals to be replenished. *This is a bit of RNG, since a signal can be replenished every 30 mins, but if you're unlucky, you get a guaranteed charge every 8 hours. Sadly waiting on two charges has a small change of exceeding the duration limit of SOS missions (12 hours)*. **If you have a Distress Signal Reception Device, you may use one or two to guarantee the two Signals.**
  - Use the two Signals, which guarantees that one of them will be the latest world you unlocked two steps above.
  - Repeat until w10 or until the highest world you have cleared. (Example: You need to clear 8-4 to be able to receive a signal for World 8)
 
  Alternatively, one may wish to just count on sheer RNG to raise the Signal Sensitivity, but as it will be explained below, raising the Signal Sensitivity quickly is **very desired**.
  
  
2. How Submarines Work
  Submarines are mostly independent and automatic, with the player being only able to activate or deactivate their **Hunter Mode** or call them into battle if they're within range.
  
2.1 Hunting Range
  A Submarine's operational area is called their Hunting Range, as seen in the example below. A Submarine Fleet's Hunting Range is determined **by the submarine in the first slot.**.

  Whenever the player moves one of their fleets any number of tiles, the Submarine fleet will move two tiles towards the nearest
